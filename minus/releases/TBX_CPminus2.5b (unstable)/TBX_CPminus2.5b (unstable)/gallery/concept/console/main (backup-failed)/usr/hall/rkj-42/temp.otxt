I have to. I must do it. If I screw something up, it's over. I'll end up like their computers. I don't want to, but I have to. They're gonna use me like some kind of killing machine again. Why? After all, they have what they want - they have disappeared from all documents, cameras, legal acts. Literally everything. What do you want from me? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

I'm fed up with all this why do you do this to me I don't want to. I don't want. I don't want. DON'T WANT. DON'T WANT. DON'T WANT.
